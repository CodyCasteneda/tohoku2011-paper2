Each folder has a .txt document labeled station_data that contains
the latitude and longitude as well as other information about the
gauge.  

The files "depth_*m.txt" in each folder contain data for each depth:
date, time (local),  velocity (cm/s) and direction (360).

Information on the sensors from the webpage:

The horizontal Acoustic Doppler Profiler (Sontek/YSIH - ADP) is a
current profiler that measures 2D velocity in a user-specified
number of depth cells over a range of up to 200m. The Stand-Alone
ADP instrument uses an external power supply and outputs serial
data that can be captured or relayed. It is commonly used for
monitoring currents near underwater structures such as piers. They
are also used for 2D vertical profiling in narrow channels to avoid
interference with channel walls. Accuracy: +/- 0.5 cm/s speed; +/-
2 degrees direction.RD Instruments manufactured the Workhorse
Monitor Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) to measure water
currents. It is usually bottom mounted and stores it's data
internally. The instrument is retrieved after a certain amount of
time and the data is downloaded to a PC where it is processed and
loaded into a database. Accuracy: +/- 0.5 cm/s speed; +/- 2 degrees
direction.
